Folder structure description
----------------------

This folder should be hold equal with the add-on headers on [dev-kit](../../kodi-addon-dev-kit/include/kodi) to make the view of relationship from them with Kodi specified to one place and in order to prevent a criss-crossing of one another.

Everything related to add-on headers should only be present here and nowhere else.

Here is the last place where Kodi structures and data should be used, everything on add-on must be complete independent from Kodi's internal parts.
